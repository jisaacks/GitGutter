## ðŸ’¾ Installation

### Package Control

It is highly recommended to install GitGutter with [Package Control](https://packagecontrol.io) as it automatically installs required [dependencies](#dependencies) and keeps all packages up to date.

1. [Install Package Control](https://packagecontrol.io/installation) if you haven't yet.
2. Open the command palette (<kbd>Ctrl+Shift+P</kbd> for Windows/Linux, <kbd>Cmd+Shift+P</kbd> for Mac)
3. Search for _Package Control: Install Package_ and hit <kbd>Enter</kbd>.
4. Type `GitGutter` and press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to install it.


##### Pre-Releases

If you are interested in testing bleeding edge features you can set up Package Control to install pre-releases by adding GitGutter to `install_prereleases` key in the `Package Control.sublime-settings`.

```JavaScript
"install_prereleases":
[
  "GitGutter"
],
```


##### GitGutter-Edge

The _GitGutter-Edge_ package is replaced by [Pre-Releases](#pre-releases).

This change was made ...

1. to avoid issues with functions which depend on the package name.
2. because branch based packages are deprecated by Package Control.
3. to have more control about when to publish new features for testing.

ðŸ‘‰ If you don't want to wait for [Pre-Releases](#pre-releases) you can pull from master branch directly.


### Manual Installation

You can clone this repository into your _Sublime Text x/Packages_


##### OSX

```shell
cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/Sublime\ Text\ 2/Packages/
git clone git://github.com/jisaacks/GitGutter.git
```


##### Linux

```shell
cd ~/.config/sublime-text-2/Packages
git clone git://github.com/jisaacks/GitGutter.git
```


##### Windows

```shell
cd "%APPDATA%\Sublime Text 2\Packages"
git clone git://github.com/jisaacks/GitGutter.git
```

ðŸ‘‰ The `git` command must be available on the command line.

ðŸ‘‰ You may need to add the directory containing `git.exe` to your `PATH` environment variable.


### Dependencies

Some functions of GitGutter depend on the following external libraries to work properly. They are installed automatically for you by Package Control, so normally don't need to care about. But on setups without Package Control you need to make sure they are installed and available in the global namespace of Sublime Text's python interpreter on your own.

- [markupsafe](https://bitbucket.org/teddy_beer_maniac/sublime-text-dependency-markupsafe)
- [mdpopups](https://github.com/facelessuser/sublime-markdown-popups)
- [pygments](https://github.com/packagecontrol/pygments)
- [python-jinja2](https://bitbucket.org/teddy_beer_maniac/sublime-text-dependency-jinja2)
- [python-markdown](https://github.com/facelessuser/sublime-markdown)

ðŸ‘‰ On OSX you might need to install the package [SublimeFixMacPath](https://github.com/int3h/SublimeFixMacPath).

ðŸ‘‰ To manually install pull from the linked repos into ST's Packages folder.


## ðŸ”« Troubleshooting

The most common reason for the icons to not show up is likely a problem with GitGutter finding the `git` executable on your [PATH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PATH_(variable)). Please read the section on the [git_binary](#git-path) setting for how to fix that.


## ðŸš€ Advanced Features

### Diff Popup

The diff popup appears by hovering the mouse over the gutter changes on Sublime Text 3 or can be called from command palette by `GitGutter: Show Diff Popup` or via a key binding.

â“˜ _popups require Sublime Text 3 Build 3070+_

â“˜ _mouse hover feature requires Sublime Text 3 Build 3116+_

![diff_popup_screenshot](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/12573621/17908698/ccbecd24-6981-11e6-8f56-edd0faaed9ec.png)

 symbol | meaning of the symbol
 -------| ---------------------------------------
 Ã—      | close the popup
 â¤’      | jump to first change
 â†‘      | jump to previous change
 â†“      | jump to next change
 â‰ˆ, â‰‰   | enable/disable difference highlighting
 âŽ˜      | copy the content of the git state
 âŸ²      | revert changes to the state in git


### Comparing against different commits/branches/tags

GitGutter compares the working copy against the HEAD by default. This behavior can be changed through the command palette.

The following options are available:

- Compare against HEAD
- Compare against particular branch
- Compare against particular tag
- Compare against specific commit
- Compare against specific file commit (current file's history)
- Compare against origin

To change the compare option:

1. Open the command palette (<kbd>Ctrl+Shift+P</kbd> for Windows/Linux, <kbd>Cmd+Shift+P</kbd> for Mac)
2. Start typing `GitGutter: Compare against`
3. You'll see the 5 options listed above, select one with the keyboard and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.
4. Choose the branch/tag/commit to compare against.

ðŸ‘‰ The changes apply temporarily to the whole repository.


### Jumping Between Changes

There are commands to jump between modifications. The default key bindings for these commands are:

 OS X                          | Windows / Linux             | Description
-------------------------------|-----------------------------|-------------
 <kbd>Cmd+Shift+Option+k</kbd> | <kbd>Ctrl+Shift+Alt+k</kbd> | Previous
 <kbd>Cmd+Shift+Option+j</kbd> | <kbd>Ctrl+Shift+Alt+j</kbd> | Next


## âš™ Settings

Settings are accessed via the <kbd>Preferences</kbd> > <kbd>Package Settings</kbd> > <kbd>GitGutter</kbd> menu.

Default settings should not be modified, as they are overwritten when GitGutter updates. Copy the relevant settings into GitGutter's user settings file instead.


#### Debounce Delay

`"debounce_delay": 1000`

Delays update of gutter icons by the following amount (in milliseconds). Useful for performance issues. Default 1000 (1 second).


#### Focus Change Mode

`"focus_change_mode": true`

GitGutter evaluates changes every time a view gets the focus by default. Set `false` to disable evaluation when changing views.

ðŸ‘‰ This setting has effect with `"live_mode": false` only.

ðŸ‘‰ GitGutter always evaluates changes after _loading_ and _saving_ a document.


#### Live Mode

`"live_mode": true`

GitGutter evaluates changes every time the file is modified by default. Set `false` to disable evaluation after each input.

ðŸ‘‰ GitGutter always evaluates changes after _loading_ and _saving_ a document.


#### Hover Diff Popup

`"enable_hover_diff_popup": true`

â“˜ _requires Sublime Text 3 Build 3116+_

GitGutter shows a diff popup, when hovering over changes in the gutter. Set `false` to disable this popup. You can still open it with a key binding and from the command palette.


#### Diff Popup Default Mode

`"diff_popup_default_mode": "default"`

â“˜ _requires Sublime Text 3 Build 3070+_

The popup displays the previous state of the content under the cursor by `"default"` but can be set to `"diff"` to highlight the differences between the git state and the editor state.


#### Diff Popup Appearance

â“˜ _requires Sublime Text 3 Build 3070+_

The popup uses the [mdpopups](https://github.com/facelessuser/sublime-markdown-popups) library and the corresponding settings are global and not only for GitGutter. Syntax highlighting can be set to match the active color scheme by adding `"mdpopups.use_sublime_highlighter": true` to the User settings.

ðŸ‘‰ Other settings can be found at [mdpopups settings](http://facelessuser.github.io/sublime-markdown-popups/usage/#global-user-settings) homepage.

ðŸ‘‰ User style settings by adding a `gitgutter_popup.css` the User directory.

ðŸ‘‰ User style settings are accessible via the settings menu.


#### Untracked Files

`"show_markers_on_untracked_file": true`

GitGutter shows icons on each line for untracked and ignored files by default. Set to `false` to hide those icons.

You may need to add scopes (`markup.ignored.git_gutter` and `markup.untracked.git_gutter`) to your color scheme to color the icons.


#### Minimap

`"show_in_minimap": 1`

GitGutter shows diffs in the minimap on Sublime Text 3 by default. Change `show_in_minimap` to one of the following values to disable this feature or change the width of the markers.

 value  | description
--------|-----------------
 =0     | hide markers
 &gt;1  | width of markers
 -1     | highlight full line


#### Git path

`"git_binary": ""`

If `git` is not found on [PATH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PATH_(variable)) by GitGutter the `git_binary` setting can be set to the location of the git binary. The value may be either a direct string to a git binary:

```JavaScript
"git_binary": "E:\\Portable\\git\\bin\\git.exe"
```

or it may be a dictionary keyed off what sublime.platform() returns, so it may be customized on a per-platform basis:

```JavaScript
"git_binary": {
  "default": "",
  "linux": "/usr/bin/git",
  "windows": "C:/Program Files/Git/cmd/git.exe"
}
```

It is valid to use environment variables in the setting value, and they will be expanded appropriately.

In a POSIX environment you can run `which git` to find the path to git if it is in your path.  On Windows, you can use `where git` to do the equivalent.


#### Protected Regions

```
"protected_regions": [
  "sublimelinter-warning-gutter-marks",
  "sublimelinter-error-gutter-marks",
  "bookmarks"
],
```

To avoid GitGutter from overriding more important gutter icons a list of protected regions can be created, which GitGutter won't add gutter icons to.

ðŸ‘‰ You will need to figure out the names of the regions to protect.


#### Show Status Bar Text

`"show_status_bar_text": true`

GitGutter displays status information about open files in the status bar by default. Set to `false` to hide the information.


#### Status Bar Text Template

```
"status_bar_text": [
  "In {{repo}} on {{branch}}",
  "{% if compare != 'HEAD' %}, Comparing against {{compare}}{% endif %}",
  ", File is {{state}}",
  "{% if deleted != 0 %}, {{deleted}}-{% endif %}",
  "{% if inserted != 0 %}, {{inserted}}+{% endif %}",
  "{% if modified != 0 %}, {{modified}}â‰ {% endif %}"
]
```

The _Status Bar Text_ is rendered using a fully customizable template from `status_bar_text`. The setting is organized as an array of strings for better readability. It is joined and then passed to [jinja2](http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/).

GitGutter provides the following variables to be used in the template.

 Variable     | Description
--------------|-------------------------------------------------------------
 {{repo}}     | repository name / folder name containing the .git directory
 {{branch}}   | checked out branch you are working on
 {{compare}}  | commit/branch/HEAD the file is compared to
 {{state}}    | One of committed/modified/ignored/untracked
 {{deleted}}  | number of deleted regions
 {{inserted}} | number of inserted lines
 {{modified}} | number of modified lines


#### Themes

`"theme": "Default.gitgutter-theme"`

GitGutter provides support for custom gutter icons and diff popup style sheets coming with theme packages. Set `theme` to a valid theme file name to activate a different icon set.

GitGutter includes following themes:

- Bars.gitgutter-theme
- Bars Thin.gitgutter-theme
- Default.gitgutter-theme
- Default HiDPI.gitgutter-theme

To provide a custom theme developers need to add a folder with all required icons and an optional `gitgutter_popup.css` file to their package. An empty JSON file `<ThemeName>.gitgutter-theme` must exist to mark this folder a resource for GitGutter icons.


#### Per-project Settings

Sublime Text supports project-specific settings, allowing `live_mode` to be enabled or disabled for certain repositories. To make use of this feature just open <kbd>Project</kbd> > <kbd>Edit Project</kbd> menu and add the `settings` key as shown.

```JavaScript
{
    "folders":
    [
        {
            "path": "src"
        }
    ],
    "settings":
    {
        "live_mode": false
    }
}
```


## ðŸ–Œ Icon Coloring

The colors come from your _color scheme_ **.tmTheme** file.
