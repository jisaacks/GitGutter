### Installation

You can install via [Sublime Package Control](http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control):

  * [GitGutter](https://sublime.wbond.net/packages/GitGutter) - Release based
  * [GitGutter-Edge](https://sublime.wbond.net/packages/GitGutter-Edge) - Stick with master branch (at your own peril)

Or you can clone this repo into your *Sublime Text x/Packages*:

*OSX*
```shell
cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/Sublime\ Text\ 2/Packages/
git clone git://github.com/jisaacks/GitGutter.git
```

*Ubuntu*
```shell
cd ~/.config/sublime-text-2/Packages
git clone git://github.com/jisaacks/GitGutter.git
```

*Windows*

GitGutter assumes that the `git` command is available on the command line. If it's not, add the directory containing `git.exe` to your `PATH` environment variable. Then clone the repo:

```shell
cd "%APPDATA%\Sublime Text 2\Packages"
git clone git://github.com/jisaacks/GitGutter.git
```

On OS X you might need to install the package [SublimeFixMacPath](https://github.com/int3h/SublimeFixMacPath).

## It's not working!?

The most common reason for the icons to not show up is likely a problem with GitGutter finding the `git` executable on your [path](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PATH_(variable)). Please read the section on the [git_binary](#git-path) setting for how to fix that.  

## Advanced Features

### Diff Popup

| symbol | meaning of the symbol                  |
| ---    | ---                                    |
| ×      | close the popup                        |
| ⤒      | jump to first change                   |
| ↑      | jump to previous change                |
| ↓      | jump to next change                    |
| ≈, ≉   | enable/disable difference highlighting |
| ⎘      | copy the content of the git state      |
| ⟲      | revert changes to the state in git     |

The diff popup appears if you hover the mouse of the gutter changes. However this functionality is only enabled in Build `3116` or newer *(which is currently only in the dev builds)*. If you are using an older Sublime Text 3 version you can also show the diff popup from the command palette or via a keybinding.

### Comparing against different commits/branches/tags

By default, Git Gutter compares your working copy against the HEAD. You can change this behaviour through the ST command palette. The following options are available:

- Compare against HEAD
- Compare against particular branch
- Compare against particular tag
- Compare against specific commit
- Compare against specific file commit (current file's history)

To change the compare option:

- Open the command palette (`Ctrl-Shift-P` for Windows/Linux, `Cmd-Shift-P` for Mac)
- Start typing `GitGutter`
- You'll see the 5 options listed above, select one with the keyboard.
- Choose the branch/tag/commit to compare against.

### Jumping Between Changes

There are commands to jump between modifications. The default keybindings for these commands are:

| OS X | Windows / Linux | Description |
|------|-----------------|-------------|
| <kbd>Command</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Option</kbd>+<kbd>k</kbd> | <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>k</kbd> | Previous |
| <kbd>Command</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Option</kbd>+<kbd>j</kbd> | <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>j</kbd> | Next |


## Settings
Settings are accessed via the <kbd>Preferences</kbd> > <kbd>Package Settings</kbd> > <kbd>GitGutter</kbd> menu.

Default settings should not be modified, as they are overwritten when GitGutter updates. Instead, you should copy the relevant settings into GitGutter's user settings file.

#### Debounce Delay
Delays update of gutter icons by the following amount (in milliseconds). Useful for performance issues. Default 1000 (1 second).

#### Live Mode
By default, GitGutter detects changes every time the file is modified. If you experience performance issues you can set it to only run on save by setting `live_mode` to `false`.

#### Hover Diff Popup
*This hover feature is only available in Build 3116 and newer.*
GitGutter shows a diff popup, when hovering over changes in the gutter. Set `enable_hover_diff_popup` to `false`, if you want to disable this popup. You can still open it with a keybinding and from the command panel.

#### Diff Popup Default Mode
*The diff popup is only available in Sublime Text 3*
The diff popup has two modes: The default mode to show the previous git state with code highlighting and the diff mode to highlight the differences between the git state and the editor state.
You can set `diff_popup_default_mode` to `"default"` or `"diff"` to change the mode in which the popup opens.

#### Diff Popup Appearance
*The diff popup is only available in Sublime Text 3*
The popup uses the [mdpopups library](https://github.com/facelessuser/sublime-markdown-popups) and the corresponding settings are global and not only for GitGutter. You can change the syntax highlighting style to the same as Sublime Text by adding `"mdpopups.use_sublime_highlighter": true` to your User settings. Other settings can be found [here](http://facelessuser.github.io/sublime-markdown-popups/usage/#global-user-settings).
In addition the popup loads the css file `gitgutter_popup.css`, which can be modified by the user and is also accessible via the settings menu.

#### Untracked Files
GitGutter shows icons for new files and ignored files. These icons will be on every line. You can toggle the setting `show_markers_on_untracked_file` to turn this feature off. Defaults to true (shows icons). You may need to add scopes to your color scheme (`markup.ignored.git_gutter` and `markup.untracked.git_gutter`) to color the icons.

#### Minimap
GitGutter will show diffs in the minimap on Sublime Text 3. This can be disabled by setting `show_in_minimap` to `false`.

#### Git path
If `git` is not found by GitGutter you may need to set the `git_binary` setting to the location of the git binary.  The value may be either a direct string to a git binary:
```javascript
{
  "git_binary": "E:\\Portable\\git\\bin\\git.exe"
}
```

Or it may be a dictionary keyed off what sublime.platform() returns, so it may be customized on a per-platform basis:
```javascript
"git_binary": {
  "default": "",
  "linux": "/usr/bin/git",
  "windows": "C:/Program Files/Git/cmd/git.exe"
}
```

It is valid to use environment variables in the setting value, and they will be expanded appropriately.

In a POSIX environment you can run `which git` to find the path to git if it is in your path.  On Windows, you can use `where git` to do the equivalent.

#### Protected Regions
Is GitGutter blocking SublimeLinter or other icons? You can prevent this by adding which regions you would like GitGutter to not override:
```javascript
"protected_regions": ["region", "names"]
```
You will need to figure out the names of the regions you are trying to protect.

#### Status Bar Text

You can turn off the status bar text by changing `"show_status": "default"` to `"show_status": "none"`.

#### Per-project Settings
Sublime Text supports project-specific settings, allowing `live_mode` to be set differently for different repositories.
To implement, use the <kbd>Project</kbd> > <kbd>Edit Project</kbd> menu and add the `settings` key as shown.
```javascript
{
    "folders":
    [
        {
            "path": "src"
        }
    ],
    "settings":
    {
        "live_mode": false
    }
}
```
