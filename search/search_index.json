Control Description Menu Main > Preferences > Package Settings > GitGutter Command Palette Preferences: GitGutter Settings Warning Default settings should not be modified, as they are overwritten when GitGutter updates. Copy the relevant settings into GitGutter's user settings file instead. Syntax, User, Project and View Settings All GitGutter settings can be placed in any of Sublime Text's settings files to provide syntax-, user-, project- or view-specific setups. The setting keys found in the GitGutter.sublime-settings need to be prefixed using git_gutter_ to do that. Each of those settings overrides the value from the GitGutter.sublime-settings. To modify GitGutter settings for an open Project just open Project > Edit Project menu and add the settings key as shown. { \"folders\" : [ { \"path\" : \"src\" } ], \"settings\" : { // git_binary is the only setting not being prefixed \"git_binary\" : \"/path/to/project/specific/git\" // git_gutter settings \"git_gutter_live_mode\" : false , \"git_gutter_ignore_whitespace\" : \"space\" } } Preferences All correctly prefixed settings can be placed into Preferences.sublime-settings instead of GitGutter.sublime-settings . Plugin-API Settings can be modified temporarily per view by calls like view.settings().set(\"git_gutter_enable\", False) General Enable or Disable Evaluation \"git_gutter_enable\" : true GitGutter evaluates changes every time the file is loaded, saved, activated or modified by default. Set false to disable evaluation and hide all gutter icons, status message and minimap markers. Caution This setting must be set as syntax- user- project- or view-specific setting! It is ignored when put into GitGutter.sublime-settings . Git Binary \"git_binary\" : \"\" GitGutter looks for the git binary in the PATH environment variable by default. The setting can be used to specify the path to a custom git installation which is not registered to PATH . run git via W indows S ubsystem for L inux (WSL) on Windows 10 by setting up a unix like path. The value may be either a direct string to a git binary: Windows \"git_binary\" : \"E:\\\\Portable\\\\git\\\\bin\\\\git.exe\" Linux/OSX/WSL \"git_binary\" : \"/usr/bin/git\" or it may be a dictionary keyed off what sublime.platform() returns, so it may be customized on a per-platform basis: \"git_binary\" : { \"default\" : \"\" , \"linux\" : \"/usr/bin/git\" , \"osx\" : \"/usr/bin/git\" , \"windows\" : \"C:/Program Files/Git/cmd/git.exe\" } Tips It is valid to use environment variables in the setting value, and they will be expanded appropriately. In a POSIX environment you can run which git to find the path to git if it is in your path. On Windows, you can use where git to do the equivalent. Environment Variables \"env\" : { \"GIT_OPTIONAL_LOCKS\" : 0 } With the \"env\" dictionary custom environment variables can be passed to git. The values overwrite the global environment variables Sublime Text is running with. Tips Keys with value None are removed from the local environment. The \"git_gutter_env\" defined per view or project hides the global \"env\" dictionary. Make sure to use the correct separator characters of your OS, if you manipulate the $PATH . Compare Against \"compare_against\" : \"HEAD\" GitGutter compares the content of the view against the HEAD of the checked out branch by default. To change this default behaviour the compare_against setting can be changed to any tag, branch or commit hash git understands. Tips This setting is overridden by the Compare Against Command Diff Algorithm \"diff_algorithm\" : \"patience\" Set diff_algorithm to one of the following values to change this behaviour. value description \"default\" The basic greedy diff algorithm. Currently, this is the default. \"minimal\" Spend extra time to make sure the smallest possible diff is produced. \"patience\" Use \"patience diff\" algorithm when generating patches. \"histogram\" This algorithm extends the patience algorithm to \"support low-occurrence common elements\". Ignore Whitespace \"ignore_whitespace\" : \"none\" GitGutter includes all whitespace when evaluating modifications by default. Set ignore_whitespace to one of the following values to change this behaviour. value description \"none\" don't ignore any whitespace changes \"cr\" ignore the carriage return at the end of lines (git 2.18+) \"eol\" ignore whitespace changes at the end of lines \"space\" ignore changed amount of whitespace \"all\" ignore all whitespace Diff Gutter Debounce Delay \"debounce_delay\" : 1000 Delays update of gutter icons by the following amount (in milliseconds). Useful for performance issues. Default 1000 (1 second). Focus Change Mode \"focus_change_mode\" : true GitGutter evaluates changes every time a view gets the focus by default. Set false to disable evaluation when changing views. Tips This setting has effect with \"live_mode\": false only. GitGutter always evaluates changes after loading and saving a document. Live Mode \"live_mode\" : true GitGutter evaluates changes every time the file is modified by default. Set false to disable evaluation after each input. Tips GitGutter always evaluates changes after loading and saving a document. Protected Regions To avoid GitGutter from overriding more important gutter icons a list of protected regions can be created, which GitGutter won't add gutter icons to. \"protected_regions\" : [ \"sublimelinter-warning-gutter-marks\" , \"sublimelinter-error-gutter-marks\" , \"bookmarks\" ] , Tips You will need to figure out the names of the regions to protect. Show Markers on Untracked Files \"show_markers_on_untracked_file\" : true GitGutter shows icons on each line for untracked and ignored files by default. Set to false to hide those icons. Scopes You may need to add scopes ( markup.ignored.git_gutter and markup.untracked.git_gutter ) to your color scheme to color the icons. Show Markers in Minimap \"show_in_minimap\" : 1 GitGutter shows diffs in the minimap on Sublime Text 3 by default. Change show_in_minimap to one of the following values to disable this feature or change the width of the markers. value description =0 hide markers >1 width of markers -1 highlight full line Themes \"theme\" : \"Default.gitgutter-theme\" GitGutter provides support for custom gutter icons and diff popup style sheets coming with theme packages. Set theme to a valid theme file name to activate a different icon set. GitGutter includes following themes: Bars.gitgutter-theme Bars Thin.gitgutter-theme Default.gitgutter-theme Default HiDPI.gitgutter-theme ( for ST2 and old ST3 dev builds ) Custom Themes To provide a custom theme developers need to add a folder with all required icons and optionally a gitgutter_popup.css file to their package. An empty JSON file <ThemeName>.gitgutter-theme must exist to mark this folder a resource for GitGutter icons. Diff Popup \u24d8 requires Sublime Text 3 Build 3124+ and mdpopups 2.0.0+ Enable Hover \"enable_hover_diff_popup\" : true GitGutter shows a diff popup, when hovering over changes in the gutter. Set false to disable the hovering feature. Tips You can still open it with a key binding or command palette . Default Mode \"diff_popup_default_mode\" : \"default\" The popup displays the previous state of the content under the cursor by \"default\" but can be set to \"diff\" to highlight the differences between the git state and the editor state. Protected Regions \"diff_popup_protected_regions\" : [ \"sublime_linter.protected_regions\" ] , To avoid GitGutter's diff popup from figting with other popups while hovering the gutter a list of protected regions can be created. If the line under the mouse cursor is occupied by one of these regions, no diff popup is displayed. Tips You will need to figure out the names of the regions to protect. You can still open it with a key binding or command palette . Stylesheet The default style of the Diff Popup is defined by mdpopups \u00b4s default.css and GitGutter\u00b4s gitgutter_popup.css . Both try their best to adapt the popup\u00b4s apeareance to the active color scheme automatically. The apeareance can be customized by an embedded stylesheet in the color scheme editing the Packages/User/mdpopups.css editing the Packages/User/gitgutter_popup.css Edit gitgutter_popup.css GitGutter\u00b4s style settings are accessible via Menu: Main > Preferences > Package Settings > GitGutter > Popup Stylesheet Command Palette : Preferences: GitGutter Popup Stylesheet Syntax Highlighting The popup uses the mdpopups library to render its content, which includes syntax highlighting. Please refer to mdpopups settings documentation for settings to change this behaviour. Line Annotation The active line of the active view is annotated with information about who changed it when. Its behaviour and the look & feel can be modified with the following settings. Show Line Annotation \"show_line_annotation\" : \"auto\" \u24d8 requires Sublime Text 3 Build 3124+ GitGutter displays information about the author of a change right next to the line using a phantom text if word wrapping is disabled. The behaviour can be modified by setting show_line_annotation to one of the following values: Value Description \"auto\" show line annotation if word wrap is disabled (default) true always show line annotation false never show line annotation Line Annotation Template \"line_annotation_text\" : \"{{line_author}} ({{line_author_age}}) \u00b7 {{line_summary}}\" The Line Annotation is rendered by jinja2 using a fully customizable template from the line_annotation_text setting. disable jinja2 Set \"line_annotation_text\": null to disable jinja2 engine. The message is formatted with a fixed template which is also used if jinja2 is not available. multiline templates The setting can organized as an array of strings for better readability. It is joined and then passed to jinja2 . Example \"line_annotation_text\" : [ \"{{line_author}}\" , \" ({{line_author_age}})\" , \" \u00b7 {{line_summary}}\" ] The following variables can be used to customize the template: Variable Description {{line_author}} the author, who introduced the change {{line_author_mail}} the e-mail address of the author {{line_author_age}} the time elapsed since the change {{line_author_time}} the time string of the change {{line_author_tz}} the timezone string of the change {{line_commit}} the hash of the changing committing {{line_committer}} the committer, who added the change to the repo {{line_committer_mail}} the e-mail address of the committer {{line_committer_age}} the time elapsed since the change {{line_committer_time} the time string of commit {{line_committer_tz} the timezone string of commit {{line_summary}} the first line of the commit message {{line_previous}} the hash of the previous commit Line Annotation Ruler \"line_annotation_ruler\" : false The Line Annotation is aligned to the end of a line with a predefined distance by default. To align the Line Annotation to the first ruler instead, you can set line_annotation_ruler to 1 . A value of 2 aligns the text to the second ruler if available and so forth. Line Annotation Ignore Whitespace \"line_annotation_ignore_whitespace\" : false Line annotations display any change including whitespace by default. Set to true to ignore whitespace when comparing the parent\u2019s version and the child\u2019s to find where the lines came from. Status Bar Text Show Status Bar Text \"show_status_bar_text\" : true GitGutter displays status information about open files in the status bar by default. Set to false to hide the information. Status Bar Text Template \"status_bar_text\" : [ \"{% if repo and branch %}\" , \"{% if not st_git_status %}\" , \"{{repo}}/{{branch}}\" , \"{% if added_files + deleted_files + modified_files > 0 %}*{% endif %}, \" , \"{% endif %}\" , \"{% if compare not in ('HEAD', branch, None) %}Comparing against {{compare}}, {% endif %}\" , \"{% if state %}File is {{state}}{% endif %}\" , \"{% if deleted > 0 %}, {{deleted}}-{% endif %}\" , \"{% if inserted > 0 %}, {{inserted}}+{% endif %}\" , \"{% if modified > 0 %}, {{modified}}\u2260{% endif %}\" , \"{% if line_author and line_author_age %}, \u27e2 {{line_author}} ({{line_author_age}}){% endif %}\" , \"{% endif %}\" ] The Status Bar Text is rendered using a fully customizable template from status_bar_text .
