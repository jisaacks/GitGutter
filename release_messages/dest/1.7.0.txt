1.7.0:
------

  A T T E N T I O N

  Due to a change in module structure you must restart Sublime Text to make
  sure GitGutter works properly!

  This release includes a major update to Diff Popup to ...

    1. ensure compatibility with upcoming mdpopups 2.0.0
    2. improve its overall look & feel
    3. clean up the code base a little bit

  Diff Popup requires

    - Sublime Text 3119 +
    - mdpopups 1.9.0 +

  Diff Popup CSS

    If you are using a customized `gitgutter_popup.css` you need to update it
    due to some required internal changes. To do so please

      1. Open Command Palette
      2. Type Preferences: GitGutter Popup Stylesheet

    Some class names changed to keep as short as possible.

    Jinja Templates are now handled by mdpopups. Thus some of the variables
    defined by Diff Popup might no longer work. But you can use all template
    variables being supported by mdpopups now.


  C H A N G E S
