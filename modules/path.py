        Note:
            This is a fix for the issue of `os.path.realpath()` not to resolve
            symlinks on Windows as it is an alias to `os.path.abspath()` only.
            see: http://bugs.python.org/issue9949

            This fix applies to local paths only as symlinks are not resolved
            by _getfinalpathname on network drives anyway.

            Also note that _getfinalpathname in Python 3.3 throws
            `NotImplementedError` on Windows versions prior to Windows Vista,
            hence we fallback to `os.path.abspath()` on these platforms.

        Returns:
            string: The resolved absolute path if exists or path as provided
