1.11.0:
=======

  This release drops support for ST2 and ST3 before build 3176.

  The release 1.10.3 was archived and will be available for older releases
  of Sublime Text, but it won't receive any updates anymore.

  The main functional change which comes with this release is a dedicated
  worker thread to run all git commands in. This change makes sure not to
  cause GUI locks if a git command takes a little longer.

   - Better submodule reloading

  Internal:
   - Drop support for Sublime Text ST2 and ST3 pre-releases
